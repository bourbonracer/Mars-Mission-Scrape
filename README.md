I wanted to generate an app that will scrape through NASA, JPL, USGS and 
space-facts website to pull the following information about the planet 
Mars:

NASA: Latest News title and teaser
JPL: Featured Mars Image
USGS: Full size image of Mars' four hemispheres
Space-Facts: Table of facts containing diameter, mass, moons, orbit, 
	temperature, etc.

The information scraped will be displayed in an html output.
